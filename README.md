## Introduction

Welcome to readMe, an app for data-driven readers. readMe allows users to save online articles to read later, as well as to see a variety of analytics and visualizations regarding their reading habits. It's built as a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) for ultimate flexibility between mobile / desktop, and online / offline usage. readMe's accompanying Chrome extension allows users to save articles with one click.

## Usage

1.  Start from the site at [https://readme2018.herokuapp.com](https://readme2018.herokuapp.com).
2.  Time to start adding articles! When you're browsing the web and come across an article you want to read later using readMe, you have two options:
    (a) Click the `+` icon at the top right of the homepage, paste the URL of the article in the resulting input field, and click "Save".
    (b) Download the readMe [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/readme%20browser%20extension?hl=en-US). Once installed, click the readMe icon in the top right of your browser toolbar and _voila!_ – your article is ready to read from the comfort of our app.
3.  Continue to read articles from readMe and accumulate data on your own reading habits!
